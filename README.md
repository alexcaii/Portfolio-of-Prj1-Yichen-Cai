# Portfolio of Project 1 - Yichen Cai

## Description of Contributions
In this project, I contributed extensively to various core aspects of the game's development. I primarily focused on designing and implementing Samus' movement mechanics, including jumping, as well as ensuring smooth camera transitions and the camera's ability to follow the character. Additionally, I worked on developing the door mechanism, handling camera transitions between rooms, and building the map and user interface (UI). I also contributed to add the audio and sound effects, implemented item pick-up functionalities, and ensured that the items had their respective effects within the game.

## Technology Used
The game was developed using Unity as the main engine, with C# utilized for scripting the gameplay mechanics, managing UI interactions, creating colliders, and handling the core logic of the game.
